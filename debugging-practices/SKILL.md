# Debugging Practices (Field-Proven, Multi-Domain)

## Overview

This skill delivers precise, actionable debugging steps for failures in software, content, documentation, UI/UX, and workflow. It addresses real-world, high-impact bug categories surfaced in AI coding sessions: logic, configuration, environment, specification drift, data/resource limits, content/policy errors, standards (accessibility, style guide) breaches, and UI/UX defects. Steps are designed for thorough root cause isolation and durable, verifiable fixes—including for micro bugs and compliance issues often missed by code-only approaches.

---

## 1. Reproduce and Gather Evidence

- **Replicate the precise failure:**  
  - Use _exact_ environment, inputs, config, file versions, and workflow steps.  
  - For UI/content bugs, use the same browser, device, zoom, and accessibility settings as affected users.
- **Collect artifacts:**  
  - Error/output logs, screenshots, terminal output, failing test cases, content diffs, and links.
  - Save both current and previous versions for side-by-side comparison.
  - For documentation/UI bugs, save broken screenshots, copy exact text, and note missing/incorrect elements.
- **Document observed vs. expected outcome:**  
  - Write down the _exact_ failure (e.g., "Last updated link is broken on updates.html", "Table header missing scope attribute", "SQL keywords lowercased against style guide").

---

## 2. Isolate and Categorize the Bug

### a. Find the Source

- **Code/Config/Workflow:**  
  - Use `git bisect`, file diffs, rollback, or minimal working examples to locate the change that introduced the bug.
  - For process/workflow: Audit each step; compare actual vs. required outputs (e.g., agent modifying read-only input).
- **Content/Documentation/UI:**  
  - Use diff tools to spot changes in text, markup, alt-text, table structure, etc.
  - For visual/UI bugs, compare screenshots or run visual regression tools (Percy, Storybook, jest-image-snapshot).

### b. Categorize (with concrete, real-case examples)

#### Logic or Implementation Bugs

- **Validate all invariants:**  
  - Confirm permissions, data shape, unique keys.  
  - Regression example: Fixing a broken template literal in a deduplication key.
- **Log/print all intermediates:**  
  - Don’t assume correctness—trace transformations.
- **Boundary tests:**  
  - Check for null, overflow, truncation (e.g., lost table rows, prompt truncation).

#### Configuration/Environment Bugs

- **Audit all config/env variables and dependencies:**  
  - Confirm deployment targets, dependency versions, secret keys.
  - Re-run provisioning after correcting syntax or ID misconfigurations.
- **Check system/OS-level constraints:**  
  - Permissions, code signing, DB state (e.g., macOS TCC, Entra ID, etc.).

#### Data & Resource Limit Bugs

- **Explicitly check for silent truncation/missing data:**  
  - Compare input vs. output for dropped or incomplete sections.

#### Specification, Standards, or Policy Drift

- **Compare implementation/output _directly_ with requirements:**  
  - Use design docs, style guides, accessibility standards (WCAG, ARIA), and assignment specs.
  - Common misses:  
    - Missing aria/scope attributes in tables.
    - Incorrect SQL casing.
    - Broken policy on read-only files (e.g., agent rewriting source).
    - Non-compliant markdown code block rendering.
- **Update or clarify ambiguous specs:**  
  - If requirements are unclear or have changed, note and resolve the ambiguity.

#### Content/Documentation Clarity & Accuracy

- **Run link and asset checkers:**  
  - Use tools (e.g., broken-link-checker) to find dead URLs, missing/broken images, outdated references.
- **Check for completeness and accuracy:**  
  - Confirm all required sections, tables, assignment titles, and naming conventions.
- **Audit documentation examples and CLI usage:**  
  - Compare with real command behavior; validate by copy-pasting into a working shell.
- **Explicitly check for micro errors:**  
  - Typos, missing words, inconsistent instructions, or unclear notes.

#### UI/UX and Accessibility Bugs

- **Automated accessibility checks:**  
  - Run tools like axe, Lighthouse, or WCAG checkers for contrast, labeling, and ARIA attributes.
- **Check for standards compliance:**  
  - Table headers must use `scope="col"`; images must have correct alt-text; links are descriptive.
- **Visual regression and manual inspection:**  
  - Automated screenshot diffing _and_ manual review in target browsers, devices, and zoom levels.
- **Enforce legibility floors and scaling:**  
  - Remove or correct small text classes that violate accessibility (e.g., remove all `text-xs`/`text-sm` classes).

## 3. Fix and Validate—Targeted, Durable Steps

- **Make focused, minimal changes:**  
  - Fix only the root cause (e.g., add early return for broken link, update OAuth scope format, correct config).
- **Automate fix application if repeated:**  
  - Use scripts/regex for large-scale or pattern-based cleanups (e.g., stripping text size classes, fixing all table headers).
- **Test fixes in all required environments:**  
  - Run both automated and manual checks—unit/integration tests, content linters, accessibility audits, link checkers, and visual regression suites.
- **Validate against original failure evidence:**  
  - Reproduce the scenario to verify the bug is resolved (e.g., re-run provisioning, reload UI, open docs in screen reader, paste CLI usage).
- **Regression test for edge/micro-case:**  
  - Add/expand tests covering the fixed edge case (e.g., self-referential link, fallback logic, missing scope).
- **Document fix scope and rationale:**  
  - Note what changed, why, and if further monitoring or automated protection (e.g., lint rule, CI check) is added.

---

## 4. Prevent Recurrence

- **Add automated checks for class of bug:**  
  - Lint rules for code, docs, markdown, accessibility, and naming.
  - Visual regression and accessibility checks in CI/CD.
- **Update documentation/specs:**  
  - Clarify requirements or standards; add examples reflecting common mistakes and fixes.
- **Share learnings with team:**  
  - Surface root causes and fixes in changelogs, retrospectives, or knowledge base.
- **Monitor for regressions:**  
  - Add or expand tests, monitoring, or logging to catch future instances early.

# Quick Debug Checklist (Summary)

- [ ] Replicate bug with original inputs, environment, and workflow.
- [ ] Gather full evidence: all artifacts, diffs, logs, screenshots.
- [ ] Pinpoint and categorize: logic, config, spec, data, content, UI/accessibility, workflow.
- [ ] Check for standards, accessibility, and style guide compliance (not just code correctness).
- [ ] Fix only the root cause; test in all relevant environments.
- [ ] Run automated and manual post-fix checks: linters, accessibility, visual regression, and user scenarios.
- [ ] Document what was fixed, why, and how it is prevented going forward.

# Example Real-Case Patterns (from AI coding sessions)

- **Workflow violation:**  
  Agent rewrote read-only input file; fix by reverting file, updating process guardrails.
- **Micro-content bug:**  
  Broken self-referential link; fix by adding guard clause for updates page.
- **UI/accessibility breach:**  
  Removed all small-text classes violating legibility/accessibility.
- **Syntax/logic error:**  
  Broken fallback in deduplication—corrected template literal.
- **Security/config bug:**  
  Path traversal vulnerability—fix by sanitizing input and guarding file writes.
- **Content style/standards:**  
  Missing table `scope` or SQL keyword casing—fix markup/code, add linter/check.
- **Documentation clarity:**  
  CLI usage note unclear—fix by editing example for accuracy and testability.
- **Infrastructure/config:**  
  Fix DB syntax and Entra ID config; confirm by successful rerun.
